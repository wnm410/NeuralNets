# Tensorflow/Keras: Digit Recognition

Here I built a neural network in Keras and in Tensorflow. Coming from a background in SciKitLearn, I appreciate the syntax of Keras. Tensorflow, on the other hand, has a syntax that is wildly different, with nods to Python's built-in vocabulary like `with` and `init`. It's useful to know both!
